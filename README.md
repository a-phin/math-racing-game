# Math Racing Game
The Math Racing Game ('Elementary Multiplication/Division Racing Demo' or MRG) was designed for The Ohio State University's Fundamentals of Engineering I (ENGR-1181) course for the Autumn 2025 semester, as part of a Software Design Project. Team C created 2 games on MATLAB given a SimpleGameEngine.m file to produce these games, one of which was the MDG I primarily contributed to.

The MRG is a game integrating simple multiplication and division practice, inspired by online math racing games.

## Getting Started
[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) is required to run the game. You must have a MathWorks account with a valid license. It is _strongly_ recommended you install version [R2024b](https://www.mathworks.com/products/new_products/release2024b.html) to ensure full functionality of the game.

After installing MATLAB, download **all** files in this repo. Run the **ElementaryMDGame.m** file to run the game.
